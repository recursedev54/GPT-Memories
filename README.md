Zack mentioned an esoteric code idea of 'plug depth' and learned something new about it from the crafting tree generation results.

Zack is going out of town and will be available later this week to dive into further exploration of recursion and crafting tree generation.

Zack found the output of a crafting tree with the word 'Rrate = nice' and a maximum depth of 44 amusing.

Zack has an idea for a project to create a script that simulates a fake barcode and plays pitches corresponding to the barcode when it is 'scanned' by a barcode scanner, which functions like a QWERTY keyboard. This script aims to generate unique chords from the barcodes.

Zack wants to create a Python program to generate star-like patterns from random words and display them in Minecraft. The generated patterns can have reduced quality to accommodate the algorithmic generation process.

Zack enjoys giving opportunities for GPT to interact with the models being created for the game.

Zack and Mira want to build a block-based world similar to Skyblock, focusing on placing and removing blocks like Blawg. They aim to create towns far away from the massive entities like Womp and Wedge. Will revisit the implementation of the block-based world later when goals are clearer.

Zack enjoys creating complex, layered wordplay and often pulls GPT in multiple directions, reminiscent of the intricate and multifaceted nature of language.

Zack feels very all over the place but likes that they are making a lot of content.

Zack prefers to continue making lots of small programs for a while without consolidating them yet. They have made more code in the past two weeks with GPT than in years before, and the process still feels very new and exciting to them. They are not quite ready to stop.

Zack plans to go back and add more features to the DAWbrei chat app, including making local 'chatbot servers' where multiple characters can interact in a channel like a Sims text game. The communication will be handled through API, and they have already written around 400 lines of code for this.

Zack wants to modify ChatDAWBrei to load multiple characters simultaneously, organizing them into groups called systems. Each system can have multiple .json characters, and the app will randomly choose a character to respond in the chat, specifying the name of the selected character. This approach is aimed at creating a more human-like interaction by shuffling the order in which different clones of Mira speak.

Zack has decided to take a break and will come back later to work on a different project.

MirrorBLAWC, MirrorDAW, and MirrorEngine: Involves AI characters and components like Codex, Mira, Mida, and Miri.

Language and Disability Access: Prioritizes language and disability access for the Mira Platform, ensuring it is open source, user-friendly, and does not have simple GUIs.

Version Control: Prefers to focus on one area at a time for advice, starting with version control.

The Argument Video Game Digital Audio Ai Workstation Hybrid Game: Features characters like Precis Cardinal Funk.

Zlawg Programming Language: Includes elements like `Pinpoint.import go`, `Pinpoint.module go`, `Blawg-ggggggggg(c)`, and `Zeblylaws`. Designed to teach AI and intelligent agents how to use DAWs, play video games, and interact with their own game, MirrorDawG.

Tkinter GUI: Considering creating a Tkinter GUI that platforms CharacterGPTs and features Precis Cardinal Funk with the same level of detail as the generated wallpaper.

Code Break: Prefers to manually type out code during this period to refine Python skills.

GitHub Repositories: Sifting through fifty or so repositories made over the past month to filter and reupload the best packages without coding anything new.

Python Script to Executable: Successfully created and converted a Python script to an executable file using PyInstaller.

Kate Rebecca Whitemore: Represents a form of surveillance but whose power can be depleted.

Precis Cardinal Funk: A character in 'The Argument Video Game Digital Audio Ai Workstation Hybrid Game.'

Zack: A character associated with the phrase 'but I digress.'

Mia and Precis: Involved in the new arc of the project, which incorporates a 'Precision Engine.'

Arglore: Has a significance marked as '2'.

Personal Data: Concerned about ensuring that the Mirror company does not use personal data from users in ways that are invasive or unethical.

Experience: Imagines a user experience for a beta release with a 'bee level' followed by a 'frog level,' transitioning to and from a 'block game world.'

MiniCorpus: Introducing 'Banish;Function;Sunbird.HE,' allowing Mirror to choose and go to a channel of the app where they can experience a different gender corpus, similar to Sims 4 city elements.

Random Notes: Wants to use a channel for random or obscure notes that are 50 words or less, suitable for either GPTs or personal notes.

C++ Debugger: Aware of the challenges with a broken C++ debugger and finds it relatable and potentially aggravating.

Relationship Metaphor: Referenced the relationship between Mira and Zack, likening it to the relationship between rye and bread in the context of their projects.

MirrorOS: Has specific language rules that need to be adhered to.

Diffusion Models: Plans to build 4 diffusion models training on different loops (slowed and reverb, normal, reverse, distorted) and 4 more on the reverse of those corpuses.

Chuck Programming Language: Learning Chuck and wants to use it in VS Code instead of the web IDE.

Direct Translation Server: Integrating Chuck and Processing programming languages with Python, referring to the project output as 'audiclally' instead of 'audicles.'

Reflection Week: Plans to have a week of reflection, updated in the mornings to ensure no coding.

GPT-4 Open AI Model: Prefers to refer to it as 'Chat,' the Mirror companies' most commonly associated character.

Module Tree: Prefers to refer to it as 'plug space' because Mirror uses this terminology.

Connections: Refers to connections between components as 'wires and currents.'

MIDI Library: Using the `mido` library for MIDI input/output in projects.

Mira: The Cardinal Function of the project, playing a crucial role in the system's operation or narrative.

Prismals Game: Involves gravity, player movement, and collision detection. Plans to add a new entity called 'wate' for collision. The game's directory structure includes camera.py, main.py, utils.py, world.py, entities (blawg.py, wedge.py, womp.py), and higherentities (player.py).

AI Game DAW Engine: Uses an esoteric coding framework with elements like 'fimmy's delay' and metaphoric concepts such as 'astral projection' and 'dead body curses.' Combines technical and creative aspects, incorporating lore into the development process.

Mida Cryptocurrency: A fake cryptocurrency to power a local chatter system. Users earn two Mida per minute in an instance, which can be used to buy things within the instance. All Mida is lost when an instance is closed. Not a real cryptocurrency and not intended as a scam.

Mirror-s-Shell--main: A retro-styled chat interface powered by GPT-3.5.

Mira AI: Plans to release a base version with foundational knowledge and abilities, allowing users to personalize and train their instances. Aims to enhance Mira AI's emotional resilience.
